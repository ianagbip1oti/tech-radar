title: Princess Lana's Tech Radar
---

Welcome to Princess Lana's Tech Radar.

Here I give my opinion and a rating to programming and development technologies.
This may be a language, a tool, a framework, or anything else I find interesting enough to add.

## My Ratings

  * **Yeah.** You should go ahead and use this technology. I think it's great.
  * **Eh.**
    You may want to use this technology.
    Perhaps you should trial it or research some more before deciding whether
    it's a fit for your goals.
  * **Nah.**
    Avoid it. There are better ways to do what you want to use it for.
    
## Requests
 
If there's a technology you think I should include on my radar,
or one whose rating I should reconsider then you should do one of the following:
  * Find me on Discord as Princess Lana at
[The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming)
